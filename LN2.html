                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A total of 120 freshmen from the mechanical and mechanical production branches of the college 
                        appeared for the initial screening test out of which, 45 were selected for the next round. In the 
                        idea pitching, the selected students were split into groups of 5 and were made to give ideas for a given problem statement â€“ which was to envision a feasible, practical instrument which can be used in times of natural disasters as an aid to the rescue activities
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea pitching round ended up receiving incredible response, with the freshmen giving wonderful ideas and after the round, 
                        15 were selected for final recruitment.
